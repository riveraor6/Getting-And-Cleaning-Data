**Data source**


The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. This dataset is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was originally made avaiable here:

**Feature Selection**

I refer you to the README and features.txt files in the original dataset to learn more about the feature selection for this dataset. And there you will find the follow description:

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

The reasoning behind my selection of features is that the assignment explicitly states "Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement." To be complete, I included all variables having to do with mean or standard deviation.

In short, for this derived dataset, these signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

 - tBodyAcc-XYZ
 - tGravityAcc-XYZ
 - tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
 - tBodyGyro-XYZ
 - tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
 - tBodyAccMag
 - tGravityAccMag
 - tBodyAccJerkMag
 - tBodyGyroMag
 - tBodyGyroJerkMag
 - fBodyAcc-XYZ
 - fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
 - fBodyGyro-XYZ
 - fBodyAccMag
 - fBodyAccJerkMag
 - fBodyGyroMag
 - fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated (and kept for this assignment) from these signals are:

 - mean(): Mean value
 - std(): Standard deviation

Other estimates have been removed for the purpose of this excercise.

The resulting variable names are of the following form: tbodyaccmeanx, which means the mean value of tBodyAcc-XYZ.
